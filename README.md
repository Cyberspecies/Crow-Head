# Crow Head
The crow head series began as a torture test and a way to consolidate the knowledge gained. Additionally it is designed to test ideas and features that are included within other projects. The head's are allowed to be worked upon however they are not allowed to have more versions, rather once a design is finished, the majority of the design must remain and any other ideas must be tested upon the finished version or put forth to the next design.

### Note:
STL Files won't be provided due to github's file upload size restrictions. Although some files are small enough to fit, it won't be a good practice if only some files are available. There are many other programs and ways to convert step to stl so it should not be much of an issue. If it is a large issue to convert the file please make an issue with this repo or add to existing ones stating it and I will concider it, however it will be difficult to keep it up on 1 platform such at github.

## D1
The first design for this is a very simple head designed to test whether or not I could build the head within a week from start to finish. Although This version did not have the best shape, it was good enough to serve its purpose.

## D2
The second design fixes the problems of the first design to be very comfortable to wear. This version looked more like a motor bike helmet and could be worn for hours, however I did have some issues with vision due to the mesh but ventillation was significantly improved due to it.

## D3
This design builds off the previous variant to be a good combination between great vision and decent ventillation. Although this version looks ok, it doesnt really fix the issues rather it just reduces them a bit. This version is the first design to combine reflective plates in the eyes to allow an LED system to be integrated directly.

## D4 (In Progress)
This design will be more of a cosplay style rather then purely hard plastic shells. The main point of this version is to be simiar to D3 however fixing many of the ventillation and vision warping issues whilst also having the capability of being water proof.
