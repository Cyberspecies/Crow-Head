# Crow Head V2
This iteration of the crow head was designed around comfort rather then aesthetic accuracy, hence resulting in only a few issues.

## Known Issues
* Vision is partially impared due to the mesh, however it is greatly improved compared to V1 as the mesh covers a large area.
* There is still not a way to properly apply pressure to the head however it is not required to wear it and is only a requirement if you want to use the moving jaw feature. It is recommended that you use a small foam sheet at the back of the head to keep it in place.
* The jaw joint requires a teflon pin and is relatively weak.
* Rubber band holder has some sharp edges which can scratch the face.

## Structure
The structure is simplier then the previous version as it has a smaller frame and requires less print sessions.

* [Crow Head V2.f3d](Crow%20Head%20V2.f3d): Main project file which contains all the necessary components required to fabricate the build.
* [Crow Head V2.step](Crow%20Head%20V2.step): A step export of the main project file.
* [Crow Head V2 Cuts.step](Crow%20Head%20V2%20Cuts.step): A step export of all the cuts.
* [Crow Head V2 Visor Pattern.step](Crow%20Head%20V2%20Visor%20Pattern.step): Similar settings as the previous version with a few adjustments. This file is designed to be printed as flat surface on the builtplate with no top and bottomlayers, we are using the 3D printer slicer software to do the meshing insead of modelling it in. Recommended settings are: 8-12 walls, 20% - 30% grid infill, 0.2mm layer height.

### Note
You need to weld the parts or spot weld them together, when welding the visor, you have to be careful but gently weld the edges to each other. Try shaping it to the visor position first before welding it.
