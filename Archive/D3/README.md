# Crow Head V3
V3 was the first to contain electrical components that were integrated directly into the build rather then being added in post. This was also the first version to have a vacuum formed visor rather then the mesh.

## Known Issues
* Visor fogs up as there is no active ventillation that is properly implemented nor any way to redirect the moist breath.
* The head retention mechanism is still lacking as the strap must be manually tensioned to the head.
* No way to attach the visor to the rest of the head without welding it or with other adhesives.

## Structure
Similar to previous models, you are required to weld the sections together, the eyes do require a bit of assembly and visor vacuum formed.

* [Crow Head V3.f3z](Crow%20Head%20V3.f3z): Contains the entire project, however the visor buck was lost so I uploaded the latest version that was produced.
* [Crow Head V3.step](Crow%20Head%20V3.step): A step file export of the project, incase you don't have Fusion 360.
* [Crow Head V3 Cuts.step](Crow%20Head%20V3%20Cuts.step): This file contains all of the cuts required to fabricate the build.
* [Crow Head V3 Visor Buck.f3d](Crow%20Head%20V3%20Visor%20Buck.f3d): The latest version of the visor buck that was fabricated, the reason they are seperate is cause the original file deleted it somewhere during production but I didnt notice so I exported a save file.
* [Crow Head V3 Visor Buck.step](Crow%20Head%20V3%20Visor%20Buck.step): A step file version incase you don't have fusion 360.

### Note
You still have to weld the pieces together as there wasn't a way to align or connect the pieces together without using heat or adhesives. The visor must be vacuum formed as there is no mesh version for this iteration of the project as it was a full switch to vacuum forming.
