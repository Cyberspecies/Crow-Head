# Crow Head V1
This is the first one of the crow head line up. Although this version is not recommended to be fabricated without foam inserts or some modifications as there are a few problems with it.

## Known Issues
* The inset eyes press against the temples causing pain after a while of wearing it.
* There is no tensioning mechanism for the head which prevents it from being worn without it rolling forward due to the unbalanced mass.
* Ball bearings of 22OD, 8ID and 7mm thickness are required to use this as the jaw joint mechanisms were not properly designed or tested yet.

## Structure
The head was not designed to be assembled uniformally, rather it must be welded together (except the eyes which are bolted with m3 screws).
